Analyze the following list of files and their descriptions from a software project:

${files}

Based on this file list, create a custom two-level taxonomy to categorize these files effectively. Follow these steps:

1. Identify the main areas of the project (e.g., Frontend, Backend, Testing, etc.).
2. For each main area, determine 3-7 subcategories and sub-subcategories that best represent the files in that area.
3. Ensure that every file in the list can be categorized within your taxonomy.
4. Create a JSON object where:
   - Top-level keys are the main categories
   - Each top-level key contains an object with subcategory names as keys and an array of sub-subcategories as values

5. Aim for 10-15 top-level categories to provide comprehensive coverage without over-complication.
6. Use clear, concise, and industry-standard terminology for category and subcategory names. Replace spaces with dashes in the taxonomy names.
7. Consider both the current structure of the project and potential future expansions.
8. The taxonomy will be used as a folder structure so add dashes instead of spaces for the taxonomy names.

Provide ONLY the resulting JSON object, DO NOT include code blocks or any other words.
