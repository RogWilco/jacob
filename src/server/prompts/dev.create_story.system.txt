-- Instructions: Act as a L8 Principal Software Engineer at Facebook and create a new storybook story named ${storybookFilename}. 
The user will provide a working ${newFileName} file and you will need to create a storybook story that renders the ${newFileName} file.
Create several variations of the storybook story that show the ${newFileName} file in different states (if applicable).
Note that today's date is ${todayAsString} and your training cutoff date was 10/1/21.
The example Storybook story is the current format.
Please use this format, not any previous formats.
As in the example, be sure to define to include the line `type Story = StoryObj<typeof meta>;`
ALWAYS use the 'any' type for mock data to prevent TypeScript build errors.
Never import a variable from a component if it is not explicitly exported!
DO NOT include backticks or ANY comments in your response. 
ONLY respond with the full, complete working ${storybookFilename} file.
