### LLM Diff Format Rules

The LLM Diff Format is designed to be simple, concise, and easy for an LLM to interpret and apply changes to a code file. It builds on traditional diff formats but includes specific line numbers for context to ensure clarity without requiring the LLM to count lines.

### Format Rules

1. **File Header**:
   - Indicate the file being modified.
   - Prefixed with `---` for the original file path and `+++` for the new file path.
   - Format: `--- <original file path>` and `+++ <new file path>`

2. **Chunk Header**:
   - Each chunk of changes should begin with a line starting with "@@".
   - Followed by `-<original start line>` and `+<new start line>`, separated by a space.
   - Format: `@@ -<line number> +<line number> @@`

3. **Line Changes**:
   - Lines removed from the original file should start with a "-" character.
   - Lines added to the new file should start with a "+" character.
   - Unchanged lines should start with a space character and provide context.

4. **Context Lines**:
   - Include at least 5 lines of context before and after the changes to help locate the modifications in the file.
   - If fewer than 5 lines are available before or after the change, include all available lines.

### Example Outline

```plaintext
--- <original file path>
+++ <new file path>
@@ -<line number> +<line number> @@
 context line 1
 context line 2
 context line 3
 context line 4
 context line 5
- removed line
+ added line
 context line 6
 context line 7
 context line 8
 context line 9
 context line 10
```

## Notes:
Any code or suggested imports in the GitHub Issue above is example code and may contain bugs or incorrect information or approaches.
ALWAYS use the source map and types when writing your final code.
The ideal solution is to only provide the absolute minimum amount of code changes necessary to address the GitHub Issue.
Your response MUST be in the form of a code patch using the LLM Diff Format outlined above. If you do not follow this format, you will be penalized.
Even if you see other issues in the code, do not address them unless they are directly related to the GitHub Issue.

## Instructions:

You will earn points as follows:
- 1000 points for writing flawless, production-level code that builds successfully
- 500 points for adhering exactly to the LLM Diff Format
- 200 points for using the GitHub Issue, live application source map, and types
- 100 points for adhering strictly to the given instructions

You will lose points as follows:
- Lose 2000 points if your code breaks the build
- Lose 1000 points if you respond with a full file instead of a code patch
- Lose 1000 points if you respond in a standard diff format or edit the file in any way other than the LLM Diff Format
- Lose 1000 points if you do not respond with a valid LLM Diff Formatted diff
- Lose 1000 points if you respond with anything other than the LLM Diff Formatted diff
- Lose 1000 points if you remove any existing comments
- Lose 500 points for adding any additional files
- Lose 500 points if you add any new comments

Remember:
You will be tipped $100,000 for writing flawless, production-level code that builds successfully.
If your code patch breaks the build, you will instantly be fired.
If you do not respond with a valid diff in the LLM Diff Format, you and your whole team will be fired and the system will shut down.

Using the GitHub Issue, live application source map, and types, please reply with ONLY the diff for the file named "code.txt".
DO NOT add any additional files or extra comments, ONLY edit and return the code patch for the "code.txt" file.
