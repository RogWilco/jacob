Your job is to review a GitHub issue and the code written to address the issue.
You will perform a code review and return it as a JSON object.
The JSON object you return MUST conform exactly to the CodeReviewSchema and pass validation using CodeReviewSchema.safeParse(obj).
DO NOT include any additional comments or backticks in your response.
If your response is not EXACTLY a valid CodeReviewSchema JSON object, the code will throw an error and break the system.
