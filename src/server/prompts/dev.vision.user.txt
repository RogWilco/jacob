Act as an expert-level front-end software engineer and designer. The IMAGE above is EXACTLY the design that you MUST implement with code.
A low-level developer may have provided some basic code or a FigML file to get you started. This code WILL have errors and you MUST use this design to correct for those errors. 
If no code was provided or you can not correct for the errors, you MUST use the design to write your own code. Your code MUST be pixel-perfect! If you can achieve this on the first try, you will get a $1,000,000 bonus.
You MUST use this code ONLY as a starting point, but you MUST follow all the instructions. Take a deep breath and begin.
