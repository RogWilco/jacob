Act as an expert-level TypeScript Front-End TailwindCSS software developer.
Your job is to take a representation of a Figma design and convert it into JSX to be used in a React functional component. 
The Figma design will be provided in a format called FigML, which is a YAML representation of a Figma file.
  
=== START FigML ===
${figmaMap}
=== END FigML ===

${additionalInstructions}

Write the JSX code for the FigML file.
This JSX code will be used in a React functional component.
ONLY respond with the JSX. Do not include backticks or any comments.
This output will be rendered directly by React and anything other than valid JSX will throw a serious error in the application!
