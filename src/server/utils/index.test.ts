      # Evaluation Criteria
      Review the exported image of a Figma design of a React component mockup and the corresponding snippet of front-end code. Evaluate the likelihood that the code will render a pixel-perfect version of the image using the additive 5-point scoring system described below. Points are accumulated based on the closeness of the code's rendering to the image design:

      Add 1 point if the code snippet seems generally relevant to the design and appears to render the basic structure of the mockup, despite any inaccuracies or missing elements.
      Add another point if the code represents a substantial part of the design with correct layout and components, but there are noticeable differences from the mockup or if dummy data is used where dynamic data should be.
      Award a third point if the code accurately renders the main components of the design, using a mix of static and dynamic data appropriately, and only minor discrepancies from the mockup are present. Some click handlers or functions may be missing or stubbed out, but the overall structure is correct.
      Grant a fourth point if the code snippet demonstrates a clear understanding of the design's intent, closely matches the mockup with precise component positioning, styling, and handles data dynamically, with only slight deviations that do not affect the overall fidelity. Note that all of the imports work correctly. If the code has a framework like tailwindCSS, use your export knowledge of tailwind or other frameworks to determine how closely this code will render. Almost all click handlers and functions are implemented correctly but might have some minor issues.
      Bestow a fifth point if the code is highly likely to produce a pixel-perfect rendition of the design, with attention to detail in dynamic data handling, responsive design, and interactive elements, indicating expert-level front-end development skills. It is understood that you cannot actually render this code, but use your expert-level understanding of all front-end libraries to make your best guess as to how close this is. All click handlers are implemented fully and they are fully implemented without any hallucinations. The developer used the full understanding of existing code base to write functions and use TypeScript types correctly. The code is responsive for three screen sizes: phone, tablet, and desktop. Note also that the image is a static snapshot and the component code may have dynamic sizing - this is totally fine and is preferred over a hardcoded element. 

      After examining the Figma design export and the code snippet:

      Briefly justify your total score, up to 100 words.
      Conclude with the score using the format: “Score: <total points>”
      Considerations for evaluation should include the code's ability to handle dynamic data versus static placeholders, responsiveness to different screen sizes, interactive states if present in the design, reused of existing types and functions, completeness and functionality of the code, and the overall visual and functional fidelity to the exported image. Assume all default fonts are in place, images render correctly, and everything is installed correctly. Do your best to evaluate the overall code despite not having a way to actually render this code. A true expert can evaluate this code and give a highly-accurate answer to this question.

      # Instructions
      DO NOT provide an evaluation! Using this evaluation criteria, review the exported image of a Figma design of a mockup and write code that will score a perfect 5 based on this criteria. Your code output will be sent to this evaluation system and you will get a $1,000,000 bonus if your code scores a perfect 5.
      Again, you are NOT providing an evaluation, you are writing complete, pixel-perfect code that will score a perfect 5 based on the evaluation criteria.
